deckbuilder.py: This is a much older personal project. I designed this program to build decks for Magic: The Gathering using popular commanders and the most popular cards that follow the restrictions imposed by the commander's colors.

kiri_ai.py: I discovered this game recently, and having experience with Markov models and machine learning, I decided to begin coding a model that learns and plays Kiri-Ai: The Duel. The end goal is to add all functionality from the game into the model, including the opponent's moves, attack cards in discard, special attacks, stances, and stance-specific attacks. However, I'm beginning with a simpler model to ensure general functionality before adding more features.
